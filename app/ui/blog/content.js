        content: `Observation is the act of noticing details, patterns, and behaviours. It is not just about watching children, by observing our children, we can gain a deeper understanding of how they learn, interact with others, and engage with their surroundings.
This is one of the most important skills we can develop as parents, the ability to observe our children. Observation allows us to understand their needs, interests, and development in a deeper way.

When engaging with them, put your phone away, and give them your undivided attention. By being fully present, you can observe their behaviour, interests, and needs more effectively. Allocate a specific period each day to attentively observe your child, free from any distractions. Focus and be completely in the moment. Pay attention not only to your child's actions but also their emotional responses and reactions. This mindful engagement will provide you with a deeper understanding of your child's world.
Notice Interests and Passions: Take note of what interests and excites your child. Observe what activities they naturally gravitate towards and what they spend the most time on. Use this knowledge to provide them with opportunities to explore and learn in those areas of interest. Offer materials and experiences that align with their passions to stimulate curiosity and spark further exploration.
Use Open-ended Questions: Encourage your child to engage in conversations Ask open-ended questions like "What are you working on?" or "Tell me about your day," Giving your child the opportunity to share his or her thoughts and experiences openly. These conversations stimulate self-reflection and expression of your child’s persona.
Observe without Judgment:
When observing your child, be open-minded and focus on understanding their unique strengths, weaknesses, and individuality. To develop our observation skills, we first need to create the right mind-set. This means setting aside our assumptions and observing without judgement, requiring you to have more curiosity and openness to new ideas. This unbiased observation will help you gain a more accurate understanding of your child's needs and abilities.
Observe Daily Routines:
Pay attention to your child's daily routines and activities. Observe how they go about tasks such as dressing, eating, and playing. Look for opportunities to encourage independence, problem-solving, and decision-making. By observing their daily routines, you can identify areas where they may need support or guidance.
Observe Interactions with Others:
Pay attention to how your child interacts with peers, siblings, and adults. Notice their communication style, social skills, and ability to collaborate and cooperate with others.
Act on Your Observations:
Utilize the information you gather through observation to adapt your parenting approach. Provide materials and activities that align with your child's interests and abilities. Adjust routines or environments that favour your child more. By acting on what you observe, you can create an environment that supports your child's growth and development.
Document and Reflect:
Some parents benefit from journaling or make notes about your observations. Reflect on your child's progress, growth, and any changes you notice over time.Documenting your observations helps you track your child's development and identify patterns or areas that may need attention.
Collaborate with Teachers:
If your child attends a Montessori school, regularly communicate and collaborate with their teachers, this is a common practice here at Lakewood that works very well. Teachers are trained observers and can provide valuable insights and guidance. Share your observations and seek their input to create a cohesive and consistent learning environment for your child.
It's fantastic that you're interested in developing your observation skills as a parent using the Montessori approach. By honing these skills, you'll be able to better support your child's growth and learning in a more thoughtful and personalized way. Keep practicing and being attentive to your child's needs and behaviours, and you'll see the positive impact it has on your relationship and their development. Remember, observation is an on-going process, and by consistently practicing, you can continue to better understand and support your child's unique needs and abilities.
Every interaction and observation helps you become a better, more attuned parent.
Keep up the great work!
